# dot-emacs

This repository contains my emacs configuration files. They were getting a bit unruly, so I've started separating them.

## Configuration

There's a couple of things required to configure the scripts.

1. Link the .spacemacs file to the home directory
2. Make sure all directory paths in .spacemacs are consistent
3. For R, point to the Rterm.exe otherwise windows will pop up errors.
