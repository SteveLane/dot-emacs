# dot-emacs

This repository contains my emacs configuration files. They were getting a bit unruly, so I've started separating them.

- `init.el` is the base configuration file
- all other packages have been split out into their own files, see `packages-*.el`
- to make python experience better, check out [this](https://gist.github.com/SteveLane/fb71f7e8d882cd3e52abac3399bdadd9) first
