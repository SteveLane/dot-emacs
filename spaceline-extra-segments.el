;;; Commentary:

;; These segments are inspired by both the spacemacs spaceline, and the
;; all-the-icons spaceline.

;;; Code:

(defvar sprazza/org-clock-format-function
  'org-clock-get-clock-string
  "The function called by the `org-clock' segment to determine what to show.")

(spaceline-define-segment sprazza/org-clock
  "Show information about the current org clock task.  Configure
`sprazza/org-clock-format-function' to configure. Requires a currently running
org clock.

This segment overrides the modeline functionality of `org-mode-line-string'."
  (when (and (fboundp 'org-clocking-p)
             (org-clocking-p))
    ;; Throw in here all-the-icons stuff
    (let ((face `(:height ,(spaceline-all-the-icons--height 0.9) :inherit)))
      (propertize
       (concat
        (propertize (all-the-icons-faicon "check-circle" :v-adjust 0.1)
                    'face `(:height ,(spaceline-all-the-icons--height 1.1) :family ,(all-the-icons-faicon-family) :inherit))
        " "
        (propertize (truncate-string-to-width (funcall spaceline-org-clock-format-function) 50 nil nil "â€¦")
                    'face face
                    'display '(raise 0.1)))
       'help-echo "Go to task"
       'mouse-face (spaceline-all-the-icons--highlight)
       'local-map (make-mode-line-mouse-map 'mouse-1 #'org-clock-goto)))
    )
  :global-override org-mode-line-string)

;; Then add it to the segments (this function expects to be called later in config)
(spaceline-all-the-icons-theme 'sprazza/org-clock)

;;; spaceline-extra-segments.el ends here
